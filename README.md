## open-source humanities education

1. Read these books. 
2. Write about them on your blog or on socials. 
3. We'll discuss them together and grow in wisdom, love, and courage.

You don't need an expensive degree to enjoy the humanities. You don't need formal education to read interesting books, become more creative, love others better, communicate more clearly, understand history, critique the present, or imagine a different future.
